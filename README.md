Shipping cost insurance for cash on delivery.

Problem: Cash on delivery is a very popular payment method for online shopping in the developing world, however, its is very costly for merchants because of the high rate of returned orders. If an ordered is not completed successfully, then merchantes need to absorb the shipping cost. 

Solution: Allow merchants to insure their shipping cost on cash on delivery orders. 

We are building an api merchants can integrate in their checkout and in real time charge a risk premium to the customer depending on their risk profile. We earn this risk premium and in return insure the order’s shipping cost. We plan to calculate the customer’s risk profile based on past orders made within the merchant network working with us. This is great because as we grow and add more merchants and process more orders, we increasingly become better at calculating risk premiums and become a more attractive solution for merchants because good customers have to pay less for ordering cash on delivery.
